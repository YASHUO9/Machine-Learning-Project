# Project: Logistic Regression for Activity Recognition System based on Multisensory Data Fusion (AReM)

Description
This repository contains a project that focuses on building an Activity Recognition System using logistic regression. The project utilizes the "Activity Recognition system based on Multisensory data fusion" dataset (AReM), which is a collection of sensor data for various human activities.

# Dataset: Activity Recognition system based on Multisensory data fusion (AReM)
The AReM dataset is a carefully curated collection of sensor data that combines information from multiple sensors to recognize different human activities. The dataset includes data from various sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, collected from individuals performing specific activities.

The activities in the dataset may include walking, running, sitting, standing, and other common daily life movements. Each data sample in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding activity, making it suitable for supervised machine learning algorithms.



# data: 
This directory contains the AReM dataset in various formats. It may include raw sensor data files, CSV files with preprocessed data, and labels for different activities.

# README.md: 
The README file you are currently reading. It provides an overview of the project, details about the dataset, and instructions on how to use the code.

# requirements.txt:
 This file lists all the Python packages and their versions required to run the code successfully. You can use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.

# Usage
If you want to use this project to build and evaluate a logistic regression model for activity recognition using the AReM dataset, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Explore the data in the data directory and understand its structure. If needed, you can preprocess the data further based on your requirements.

Open the logistic_regression.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially. The notebook will guide you through data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
